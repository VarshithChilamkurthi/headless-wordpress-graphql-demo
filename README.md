Steps to implement the project:

1. Clone this repository by
   ```git clone https://github.com/VarshithChilamkurthi/headless-wordpress-graphql-demo.git```
3. ```npm install``` to install all the dependencies.
4. ```npm run dev``` to run on the local host.
5. But before running the project, we need to set up the wordpress account locally. For that, I used Local to create a new wordpress CMS with admin credentials.

6. Add few demo posts to fetch using Graphql.
